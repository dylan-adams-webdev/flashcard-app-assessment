# Flashcard-O-Matic

A simple React front end that allows users to study using digital flashcards that the user creates.

### Context

This project was created as a graded project for [Thinkful](https://thinkful.com) to learn React and React-Router. The purpose, besides as a utility to learn the technologies and to assess the ability to construct a web application with multiple screens, is to provide an easy-to-use utility for studying and memorizing information. 

### Installation

- Fork and clone this repository to your local machine (main branch)
- ```npm install``` to load all the required packages
- ```npm start``` will run a ```json-server``` instance with a sample flashcard deck
- Create a deck and cards and begin studying!

### Technologies

This project was built using React (```create-react-app```) and Bootstrap. The purpose of this project was to use newly acquired React knowledge in a real project. Bootstrap was chosen due to minimize development time to focus on learning React.

### Discoveries

This project taught me that the file structure of React apps can get out of hand fast. It is important to follow a pattern for the components and routes.
I also learned that there are a number of fantastic libraries for React that solve common problems like messy API calls and global state. 

### Future Plans

This project will be extended to include a backend (in a separate repo). This project will also eventually be refactored to include the helpful packages to further the learning that this project has afforded thus far.

### NOTE

Connect with me if you have suggestions or ideas that could help make this application better, more manageable, or if you see something that does not follow industry best practices! I love to talk with other developers; there is always something to learn.

### Thanks!

Thank you for dropping by!!!
